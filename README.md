# Portfolio-Website_old
First portfolio website I created to practice using HTML/CSS and Javascript to showcase my designs in UX work.

# Portfolio Website - Santiago De La Garza

This is my initial portfolio website, created to gain experience in coding and showcase my UX and web design projects.

## Files

### `index.html`

This file contains the main structure of the website. It includes the HTML markup, links to stylesheets and scripts, as well as the content for the different sections of the site, such as the header, about me, services, portfolio, and contact sections. The HTML file is responsible for rendering the content and layout of the website.

### `style.css`

The `style.css` file contains the cascading style sheet rules that define the visual design of the website. It specifies the layout, colors, fonts, and styles for various elements on the webpage. CSS is used to ensure that the website looks aesthetically pleasing and is responsive across different devices and screen sizes.
